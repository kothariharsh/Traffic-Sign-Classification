# Traffic-Sign-Classification
The goal of this project is to implement a classifier using deep learning to predict traffic signs using Tensorflow library.
I implemented a CNN  with three layers and one fully connected layer which is inspired by the work of Yann LeCun. I used Relu as the activation function and implemented augementaion and dropout.
I was able to acheive 98.2% validation accuracy and 91.2% test accuracy. The model was implemented using tensorflow.
