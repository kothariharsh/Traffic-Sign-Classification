# Traffic-Sign-Classification
The goal of this project is to implement a classifier using deep learning to predict traffic signs using Tensorflow library.
I implemented a CNN  with three layers and one fully connected layer which is inspired by the work of Yann LeCun. I used Relu as the activation function and implemented augementaion and dropout.

### Importance of your problem:
Traffic signs are an integral part of our road infrastructure. Traffic sign recognition is just one of the problems
that computer vision and deep learning can solve. This model will be useful in significantly improving safety and
in the implementation of an important step on the way to autonomous driving. Being able to automatically
recognize traffic signs enables us to build “smarter cars”. The same problem can be found in other fields where
we need image recognition and some of the examples include lane recognition for smart cars, number
recognition, and a lot more.

I was able to acheive 98.2% validation accuracy and 91.2% test accuracy. The model was implemented using tensorflow.
